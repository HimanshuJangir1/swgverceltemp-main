      "KGP is a great time for exploration. Be extremely selfish about taking out the most value for yourself out of this experience. You should not worry about rejections, interns or placements. In the long run these things do not matter. You should focus on creating your own brand. Always believe in living a big life (larger than yourself).",

      "In the CDC internship drive, the number of companies coming for products is generally less. An all-rounded CV is preferred, and past interns in Product might help. Don’t lose hope/confidence, even if you are not able to make it. Your career is a 30+ years journey ahead. 1/2 years up and down hardly contributes to 3% of it. So don’t give up hopes, keep hustling, and you can find a career that satisfies you!",

Keep giving contests on platforms like Codeforces and Codechef to practice solving questions in a time-bound environment. Also, keep a good habit of calculating time complexity and space complexity while solving a problem.",
